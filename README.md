# Food-Sale-Predictions

## **Overview:**
---
This model provides the data of all food items in certain grocery stores in India, to predict which items will sell. It includes a data dicitonary to easily explain to the reader what each column represents; Exploratory and Explanatory visuals displaying correlations, utilizing scatterplots, and box plots.

## **Insight**
---
- Includes a line plot of the sales over the established outlet years in Indian Rupies
- Includes a scatter plot of the sales with their corresponding MRP

## **Model Metrics**
---
Model metrics of this data set summarizes the MSE, MAE, R2, and RSME of each model (bagged trees, linear regression, regression trees). Evaluations of this data set can tell which model is a better fit on our data set and the summary of how big our error data is.

## **Recommendation**
---
I recommend using the decision regression tree. The regression tree will be the best model to use due to the better fit and fewer errors.
